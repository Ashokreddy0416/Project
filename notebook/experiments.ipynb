       "'<think>\\nOkay, so I need to figure out what the capital of France is. Let me start by recalling what I know about France. I remember that France is a country in Europe, and it\\'s known for cities like Paris, Lyon, Marseille, and Bordeaux. But which one is the capital? I think Paris might be the capital. Wait, but how sure am I? Let me think.\\n\\nI know that Paris is a major city in France, famous for the Eiffel Tower, the Louvre Museum, and Notre-Dame Cathedral. It\\'s a big tourist destination. Also, I\\'ve heard of Paris being referred to as the \"City of Light.\" But does that mean it\\'s the capital? Maybe. I also remember learning in school that the capital of France is Paris, but I need to confirm that. \\n\\nLet me consider other possibilities. Lyon is another large city; I think it was once the capital of the Roman Empire in the region, but that was a long time ago. I don\\'t think it\\'s the current capital. Marseille is a significant port city, but again, not the capital. Bordeaux is known for its wine, not likely to be the capital. \\n\\nI can also think about other countries and their capitals. For example, the capital of Germany is Berlin, Spain\\'s is Madrid, Italy\\'s is Rome. So France\\'s is Paris. That seems to fit the pattern. Also, in movies and books, when they mention France, they often refer to Paris as the main city. \\n\\nWait, but could there be confusion with the city of Paris being part of a larger region? Maybe Paris is part of Île-de-France region, but the capital is still Paris itself. I think that\\'s right. \\n\\nAnother angle: government and political aspects. The French President\\'s office is in Paris, right? The Élysée Palace is in Paris. The National Assembly is also there. So the government is centered in Paris, which would make it the capital. \\n\\nI might also check historical context. Has the capital ever been different? I think during the French Revolution, the capital was still Paris. Maybe during some periods it was moved, but not recently. \\n\\nSo putting it all together: Paris is the capital of France. I can\\'t think of any reason to doubt that. Unless there\\'s some recent change I\\'m not aware of, but I don\\'t recall hearing about France changing its capital. Therefore, the answer should be Paris.\\n</think>\\n\\nThe capital of France is **Paris**. \\n\\n**Key Points Supporting This Answer:**\\n1. **Geographical and Cultural Significance**: Paris is the largest city in France and a global hub for art, fashion, and culture, known for landmarks like the Eiffel Tower and the Louvre.\\n2. **Political Center**: The French government, including the President’s official residence (Élysée Palace) and the National Assembly, is headquartered in Paris.\\n3. **Historical Context**: Paris has served as the capital of France for centuries, even during major historical events like the French Revolution.\\n4. **Regional Context**: While part of the Île-de-France region, Paris itself is the capital city, not the region.\\n5. **Common Knowledge**: Paris is widely recognized as France\\'s capital in global references, education, and media.\\n\\n**Conclusion**: Paris remains the undisputed capital of France. 🇫🇷'"

The best performing such models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attentionm echanisms.  We propose a novel, simple network architecture based solely onan attention mechanism, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely.Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superiorin quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less timeto train. Our single model with 165 million parameters, achieves 27.5 BLEU onEnglish-to-German translation, improving over the existing best ensemble result by over 1 BLEU. On English-to-French translation, we outperform the previoussingle state-of-the-art with model by 0.7 BLEU, achieving a BLEU score of 41.1.',\n",
